# What is this?

This is a library for xml canonicalization  

# What is it not?

An Xml parser, validator, Xml builder.

You can build XML structures with i guess... but i would recomend you keep serilization code and validation code seperate.

But you can in theory build an xml with it and output it canonicalized, but that is not the idea right now.
